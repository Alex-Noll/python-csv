# Python CSVs
## Code Em Assignment - Middle Intermediate

CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. Most basic spreadsheets can be
saved in this format. You can define a single row for column headers
and then a row for each set of values.

This assignment includes an example python module that you should go
through and execute. At the end of the module is the detailed assignment.

## Minimum Requirements

* Create your own "database" of csv data in a separate file -- your
  program should read that data into a useful data structure.
* Create a scheme to overcome key collision (explained in the example
  module). 

## Additional Requirements (think super extra credit)

* Create another csv of data that is related to your first file. Use
  the relation to read both files into a structure to enable useful
  retrieval. For example, say you want to get all the songs on an
  album given one song on the album:
  `useful_dict["Wheels"]["album"]["songs"]`
